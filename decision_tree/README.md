## Introduction
This directory contain the code to learn a decision tree to act on the simulator.

## files
- data_generation.py allow to generate your own dataset
- decision_tree.py contain the decision tree model class
- test_tree.py contain the code to test a decision tree model
- params.json is an exemple of parameters file used to specify a decision tree's hyperparameters
- dataset.zip contain the dataset used in the paper "Deep reinforcement learning with predictive auxiliary task for train collision avoidance". It is also the dataset used on the exemple parameter file and it should be decompressed before usage.
